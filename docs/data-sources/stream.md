# timeplus_stream (Data Source)

Timeplus streams are similar to tables in the traditional SQL databases. Both of them are essentially datasets. The key difference is that Timeplus stream is an append-only (by default), unbounded, constantly changing events group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "timeplus_stream" "example" {
  name = "basic_example"
}

output "example_stream" {
  value = data.timeplus_stream.example
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The stream name

### Optional

- `history_ttl` (String) A SQL expression defines the maximum age of data that are persisted in the historical store
- `retention_bytes` (Number) The retention size threadhold in bytes indicates how many data could be kept in the streaming store
- `retention_ms` (Number) The retention period threadhold in millisecond indicates how long data could be kept in the streaming store

### Read-Only

- `columns` (Attributes List) The columns of the stream (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--columns))
- `description` (String) A detailed text describes the stream

<a id="nestedatt--columns"></a>
### Nested Schema for `columns`
