# timeplus_stream (Resource)

Timeplus streams are similar to tables in the traditional SQL databases. Both of them are essentially datasets. The key difference is that Timeplus stream is an append-only (by default), unbounded, constantly changing events group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "timeplus_stream" "basic_example" {
  name = "basic_example"

  description = "A simple stream with three columns"

  column {
    name = "col_1"
    type = "string"
  }

  column {
    name = "col_2"
    type = "int32"
  }

  column {
    name    = "col_3"
    type    = "datetime64(3)"
    default = "now()"
  }
}

resource "timeplus_stream" "codec_example" {
  name = "codec_example"

  description = "An example shows how to use codec on columns"

  column {
    name  = "col_1"
    type  = "string"
    codec = "LZ4"
  }

  column {
    name = "col_2"
    type = "int32"
  }

  column {
    name    = "col_3"
    type    = "datetime64(3)"
    default = "now()"
  }
}

resource "timeplus_stream" "retention_example" {
  name = "retention_example"

  description = "An example shows how to customize retention plicy on a stream"

  column {
    name = "col_1"
    type = "string"
  }

  column {
    name = "col_2"
    type = "int32"
  }

  column {
    name    = "col_3"
    type    = "datetime64(3)"
    default = "now()"
  }

  retention_bytes = 10 * 1024 * 1204 * 1024 // 10Gi in bytes
  retention_ms    = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days in ms 
  history_ttl     = "to_datetime(_tp_time) + INTERVAL 30 DAY"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The stream name
<!--
  Due to the framework limitation, it's impossible to define a block attribute as `required`. Thus we need to manually move it to this `Required` section.
-->
- `column` (Block List) Define the columns of the stream (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--column))

### Optional

- `description` (String) A detailed text describes the stream
- `history_ttl` (String) A SQL expression defines the maximum age of data that are persisted in the historical store
- `retention_bytes` (Number) The retention size threadhold in bytes indicates how many data could be kept in the streaming store
- `retention_ms` (Number) The retention period threadhold in millisecond indicates how long data could be kept in the streaming store

<a id="nestedblock--column"></a>
### Nested Schema for `column`

Required:

- `name` (String) The column name
- `type` (String) The type name of the column

Optional:

- `codec` (String) The codec for value encoding
- `default` (String) The default value for the column
